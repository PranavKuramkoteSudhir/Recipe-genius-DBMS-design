Project Overview - Recipe Genius:
In the Recipe Genius project, our focus was on developing a robust Database Management System. This involved crafting an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model and translating it into a logical model. We implemented the database using MySQL, generated relevant data sets, and extensively ran queries to ensure optimal functionality. This endeavor seamlessly integrated theoretical modeling with practical application, creating a dynamic platform for efficient recipe data management and analysis.
